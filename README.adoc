This repo contains a collection of my examples of using the Spring Cloud Stream (SCSt) messaging framework to 
build message-driven microservices (services that use async messaging APIs to integrate with other services on top of 
a shared message broker) in a declarative, broker-agnostic manner.

Each example is implemented as a standalone app or apps(s). The source code for each is contained within a separate
sub-folder within this repo.

A summary of the examples produced to date is provided below. 

== Basic examples
This folder contains services which provide basic examples of using core SCSt features.

*basic/logging-consumer* - This project comprises a single service that provides an example of a POJO based message
consumer implemented using SCSt's `@StreamListener` support that consumes messages from a single input message channel deployed
on a RabbitMQ message broker.
